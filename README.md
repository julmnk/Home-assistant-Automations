# Home-assistant-Automations
Sharing my work, maybe it will help someone on ideas how to automate LG A/C and hybrid inverters work
Shared automation's requires those HA integrations:
- Inverter (in my case Solis Modbus. In case of Solis inverter maybe it will work also Solis Cloud)
- Nord Pool 
- LG ThinQ
- Solcast PV Forecast (you need to register at https://toolkit.solcast.com.au/  to generate API Key)

You need to verify yours exact entity_id at HA Developer tool
